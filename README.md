# Deployment

The site is auto-deployed whenever a new commit is made to the project. To see it, go to
[here](http://montrealfc.herokuapp.com).

# Editing

As usual, you can clone the project and modify locally. Or to make changes directly on Github, you can
use the [Prose.io app](http://prose.io/#MontrealFloorballClub/montrealfc).
