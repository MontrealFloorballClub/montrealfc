# The Players

Two teams are each allowed a maximum of five players and a goalie on the court
at one time. Players do not wear protective equipment like hockey; only a
jersey, shorts and indoor athletic shoes are required. Floorball goalies,
however, wear some protective equipment such as knee pads, chest protector and
a goalie mask. Goalies do not use sticks, blocking shots with their hands and
body and play most of the game on their knees.
