**The Sticks** are lightweight, durable, around 100 cm in length and vary in flexibility. Shorter than hockey sticks, floorball sticks are
engineered for superior stick-handling, ball control and shooting.

**The Nets** are at either end of the rink, 160 cm wide x 115 cm high. They are similar to hockey nets except they are a little smaller to
compensate for the lack of large protective gear for goalies.

area is 2.5 m x 1 m and the goal area is 5 m x 4 m.
