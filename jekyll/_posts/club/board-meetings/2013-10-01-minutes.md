1. Fees

Brainstorming discussion about membership fees lead by Stéphane
Laporte.

Brainstorming discussion about recruiting new members. Idea suggested
by Stéphane to reach out to ball hockey players and maybe
setup challenge matches.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Finances

Fabien annonces that the club is running a deficit.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Sponsorships

Discussion about finding sponsors.

Stéphane suggests hosting 3on3 tournaments during the year to raise
money. Stéphane will look into organizing this.

first place: percentage + free entry in next tournament
second place: percentage + free entry in next tournament
organizers: 10%
rent: 32%

Kurre suggest organizing a demo event somewhere downtown during the
summer (during a sidewalk sale).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Brampton tournament

Eero tells us that Ottawa has pulled out. So it is not worth us for us
to go. We could probably be playing against them before the Montréal
Open, or before the January tournament.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Website

Eloi starts a discussion about the website.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Montréal Open

Eero says that there will possibly 12 teams. He will hold a referee
clinic soon so we have enough refs for the tournament.
